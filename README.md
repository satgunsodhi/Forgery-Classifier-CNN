# README.md for Forgery-Classifier-CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image forgery detection and classification. The system is designed to analyze digital images and determine their authenticity by identifying potential signs of manipulation or forgery.

## Project Description

The Forgery-Classifier-CNN leverages deep learning techniques to detect image forgeries, a critical application in digital forensics and media authentication. The CNN architecture is trained to distinguish between authentic and manipulated images by learning features that are indicative of common forgery techniques.

## Features

- **Binary Classification**: Classifies images as authentic or forged
- **Deep Learning Architecture**: Utilizes CNN for robust feature extraction
- **Image Preprocessing**: Handles various image formats and sizes
- **Training Pipeline**: Complete training workflow for model development
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive performance assessment

## Technical Approach

The project employs a CNN-based approach similar to other successful image forgery detection systems. The methodology typically involves:

1. **Feature Extraction**: CNN layers extract hierarchical features from input images
2. **Pattern Recognition**: The network learns to identify artifacts and inconsistencies typical of forged images
3. **Classification**: Final layers perform binary classification (authentic vs. forged)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/satgunsodhi/Forgery-Classifier-CNN.git
cd Forgery-Classifier-CNN

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

### Testing/Inference

```bash
python test.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Dataset

The model can be trained on various image forgery datasets commonly used in research:

- **CASIA Dataset**: Popular benchmark for image tampering detection
- **COVERAGE Dataset**: Used for highlighting forged image regions
- **Custom Datasets**: The architecture can be adapted for domain-specific datasets

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture likely includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction at multiple scales
- **Pooling Layers**: For dimensionality reduction
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For final classification
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU or similar for non-linearity
- **Dropout**: For regularization to prevent overfitting

## Performance Considerations

Image forgery detection CNNs typically achieve:

- **High Accuracy**: Modern CNN approaches can achieve 90%+ accuracy
- **Robustness**: Effective against various forgery techniques including splicing, copy-move, and inpainting
- **Scalability**: Can handle large-scale image datasets

## Applications

This forgery classifier can be applied in:

- **Digital Forensics**: Authenticating evidence in legal proceedings
- **Social Media**: Detecting manipulated content
- **News Verification**: Ensuring authenticity of published images
- **Security Systems**: Preventing fraud through image manipulation
